      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#333333">1. 
        Drag your image file onto the Zoomify Converter to rapidly convert it 
        into a Zoomify Image folder. (You can ignore the temporary file &quot;zoomifyConvertPrefs.asp&quot; 
        that is also created each time the converter runs. Feel free to delete 
        it if you like.)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#333333"> 
        2. Edit the TemplateWebPage.htm file in any HTML or text editor. Change 
        the text &quot;ZoomifyExampleImage&quot; to the name of your Zoomify Image 
        folder. Be sure to change this text in two places in the file (the first 
        is for Windows IE users, the second is for everyone else). Save the file.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#333333">3. 
        Copy your Zoomify Imagefolder, your edited TemplateWebPage.htm file, and 
        the ZoomifyViewer.swf file to your Web server - that's it - the web page 
        is ready for your site visitors to view your image!<br>

      <p align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Zoomify 
        products enable image content creators to easily author and publish high-quality 
        images for fast, intuitive viewing over networks such as the Internet 
        and on distributable media such as CDs and DVDs. Accordingly, the Zoomify 
        License Agreement provides the greatest possible flexibility for Zoomify's 
        customers.</font></p>

      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ALLOWED USES</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AUTHORING 
        PROGRAMS</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Zoomify 
        Converter is used to prepare images for zoom-and-pan viewing. The Converter 
        is licensed per user, and may not be redistributed without a written reseller 
        agreement with Zoomify.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Zoomify 
        Enterprise Converter is likewise used to prepare images for zoom-and-pan 
        viewing, however, its functionality can be automated via scripting. This 
        allows image conversion as part of server-side system. The Enterprise 
        Converter is therefore licensed per server. The Enterprise Converter may 
        not be used on more than one server without the purchase of a multi-server 
        license or site license. The Enterprise Converter may not be redistributed 
        without a written reseller agreement with Zoomify.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Zoomify 
        Converter may not be used to create an image conversion or 'zoomification' 
        service. That is, images may be converted and distributed, however, they 
        should not be converted solely for the purpose of distribution. Where 
        converted for distribution, they should accompany content, software, or 
        other added value. Individuals with a need for &agrave; la carte or on-going 
        image conversion should acquire a license for a Zoomify product that includes 
        the Zoomify Converter.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Zoomifyer 
        Enterprise Converter may be operated via command line only for internal 
        use. You may not resell access to the Zoomifyer Enterprise Converter on 
        a fee basis, whether a perimage fee or a time-based access fee. In other 
        words, you may create images for your clients and customers, but you may 
        not run an image-encoding service. If your clients or customers wish to 
        convert images for their own use, they must purchase a license appropriate 
        for their use.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">IMAGE CONTENT</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Zoomify images, 
        the content authored and viewed with Zoomify products, is the property 
        of the content creator and may be published, distributed, and viewed without 
        royalty. Zoomify does not charge any fees for use of the images whether 
        based on image volume, viewing traffic, time period, or other criteria. 
        Zoomify images do not require any 'broadcast key' or other licensing technology.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As noted 
        above, images should not be converted solely for the purpose of distribution 
        as in the case of a conversion or 'zoomification' service. This is a limitation 
        on the use of the Zoomify Converter, not a restriction on the image content 
        of the customer.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">VIEWERS</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Zoomify 
        Viewers are used to view images that have been converted for zoom-and-pan 
        viewing. The Viewers are used in published form as Flash movie 'SWF' files. 
        In this form the Viewers may be redistributed on networks and distributable 
        media. This includes the standard Zoomify Express Viewer (formerly EZ 
        Viewer), Design Viewer, Slideshow Viewer, Gallery Viewer, Hotspot Viewer, 
        Watermark Viewer, Comparison Viewer, Tour Viewer, Rotation Viewer, Geo 
        Viewer, and such other viewers as Zoomify provides with the exception 
        of the Zoomify Annotation Viewer (see below).</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Viewers on 
        distributable media must be accompanied by this License Agreement. Viewers 
        distributed for commercial purposes must clearly include modifications 
        and works within the scope of which the Zoomify Viewer is not the primary 
        source of value - that is, the Viewer 'SWF' files should not be redistributed 
        without accompanying content, software, or other added value.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Zoomify 
        Annotation Viewer is also used to view images that have been converted 
        for zoom-and-pan viewing, however, its functionality depends on additional 
        server-side data and it is typically used as part of a server-side system. 
        The Annotation Viewer is therefore licensed per server. The Annotation 
        Viewer may not be used on more than one server without the purchase of 
        a multi-server license or site license. The Annotation Viewer may not 
        be redistributed without a written reseller agreement with Zoomify.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No Zoomify 
        Viewer shall be redistributed as part of a paid or free product with zoomable 
        image content created by any means other than a Zoomify converter obtained 
        with a licensed copy of a Zoomify product unless specifically permitted 
        by a written reseller agreement with Zoomify.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SOURCE CODE</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Zoomify 
        Viewers are created using Adobe Flash. They are used in published form 
        as Flash movie 'SWF' files. The Viewers are authored in editable form 
        as Flash movie 'FLA' and 'AS' source code files. Zoomify Viewer source 
        code files and source code may not be redistributed without a written 
        reseller agreement with Zoomify.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Zoomify products 
        include editable source code files to enable Zoomify customers to modify 
        the look and functionality of the Viewers as well as to allow the addition 
        of zoom-and-pan functionality to customer Flash projects. Such use results 
        in the creation of new publishable 'SWF' files. Such 'SWF' files may be 
        redistributed under the following requirements:</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. The 'SWF' 
        files must include the Zoomify copyright information, unmodified, from 
        the original Zoomify source files. 'SWF' files on distributable media 
        must be accompanied by this License Agreement.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. The 'SWF' 
        files must be created using the Publish setting 'Protect From Import' 
        of the Adobe Flash editing software.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Where 
        modifications are made to the Zoomify Viewers the modified 'SWF' files 
        must include user-viewable information stating that the Viewers have been 
        modified and including support contact information for the author of the 
        modifications.</font></p>

      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Note that 
        Zoomifyer EZ and Zoomify Express as well as other Zoomify products may

        of the product. Specifically, Zoomifyer EZ and Zoomify Express, products 
        typically provided by Zoomify for no charge, include splash screen logos 
        and other branding that must not be removed. Decompilation, disassembly,
